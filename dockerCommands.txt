Install Docker on EC2 Instance
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
systemctl list-unit-files | grep docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
cat /etc/group
cat /etc/os-release 
id ec2-user
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user [ -a means adding and -G means group ]
sudo systemctl restart docker
exit
Re Login to EC2 and try this command
 i. docker info
 Now you can run a sample application
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins
   -d (run container in detached mode, in the background)
   -p port mapping <host-port>:<container-port>
Host port can be any available port
The container port must be the same as the application configured on the container.
docker ps (To see running containers)
docker ps -a (To see both running and excited)
Access the application (ec2publicip:8080(hostport))

to get inside container(bash will work if os matches the one in container)
docker exec -it <container-id>/<container-name> bash
ctrl+p+q (to come out of container)
